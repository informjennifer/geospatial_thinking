# geospatial_thinking
This repository supplements the hands-on section of the OER, Geospatial Thinking and Open Source GIS

The gitbook will be broken into modules which increase in complexity.
The software needed to do the exercises is QGIS: https://qgis.org/; I'm using version 3.42.2, but I recommend you download the most recent stable version.
In each module, you will need to go find the datasets needed to do the work.
